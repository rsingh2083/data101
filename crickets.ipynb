    "A long, long time ago, in the summer of 1898, Ernst Athearn Bessey and his brother Carl decided to observe tree crickets in Lincoln, Nebraska. (Ernst was 21 at the time and just finished his MA degree) They were interested in the relationship between the speed of cricket chirps and outdoor temperature. The thing that made this a bit easier was that they found \"that each cricket remained in the same tree for days at a time.\"\n",
