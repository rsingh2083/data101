    "The zigzagging gray line represents the actual yearly average temperatures and the blue one smoothes out the data points. There has been a pretty dramatic increase in the temperature since the mid 1970s.  As you recall from our Weather Python Notebook the rise of atmospheric CO2 has been increasing steadily. Prior to the mid-1970s we also emitted a lot of particulate matter into the atmosphere. This had the effect of reflecting sunlight so it mitigated the effects of atmospheric CO2. In the 70s many countries regulated particulate emissions because they caused things like acid rain. Without those particulates the atomospheric CO2 raised the temperatures.\n",
